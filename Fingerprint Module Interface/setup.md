/*The Adafruit library required for this process was obtained here: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library*/

Welcome to the first step in setting up your Arduino for fingerprint interfacing. 

PROCEDURE:
-Once cloned transfer the Adafruit Library to the Arduino/Libraries/ file in Root directory(/usr/share/).
-Open the .ino file using Arduino software.
-Add the Keypad library from the IDE (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad#Download).
-Add the LCD library from the IDE.
-Connect the hardware created to computer.
-Run the code.
